1. The purpose of this Git repository is to have a collection of my work as a reference for myself of what I learned in the class, and also to show employers.

2. My favorite assignment has been the group project because I have been able to work on multiple different parts of the project, and I got to be a part of the decision making process.

3. I think I have grown a little bit in a lot of areas-- so I think I have grown quite a bit.


4. Before this course, I started making a website for my friend, called mrrec.org. I did alright teaching myself, but there were still some fundamental parts of web programming that I didn't even know I didn't understand. I now have much more general knowledge about what is going on under the hood, which makes it easier to debug and work on features. Two specific things I learned that have already been helpful: 1) I shouldn't style elements directly in the html, and instead I should use classes and id's. Also scss is incredibly useful. This seems like a small example, but not understanding inheritance and overwriting was a pain before this class. 2) Understanding more about how websites connect to servers has also been important for me.

5. I would like to learn more about user experience and interface design. This wasn't covered in much detail in the course, but it was a hidden part of mostly every project.
